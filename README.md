<h1 align="center"> Data Structure Implementations</h1>

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

# Classification: 

- Data Struture
    - Linear (sequentially)
      - Static (has a fixed memory size)
        - Array
      - Dynamic (the size is not fixed)
        - Quee
        - Stack
        - Linked List
    - No-linear (data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly )
      - Tree
      - Graph
      - Heap
      - Hash

# Types in Java

	- Array (Single dimensional Array, Multidimensional Array)
	- Linked List (Singly-linked list, Doubly Linked list, Circular Linked List)
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Binary Tree
	- Binary Search Tree
	- Heap (MaxHeap, MinHeap)
	- Hash (HashSet, HashMap)
	- Graph 

# Types of Data Structures

  - Primitive: are also called Primitive Data Types. byte, short,  int, float, char, boolean, long, and double are primitive Data types;
  - Non-primitive: Non-primitive.
